There once was a boy named Keegan. He was a very friendly and nice boy. However, one day he got stuck between a rock and a hard place. 
He was trying to get home to relax after a day of struggles, but a large rock with a face blocked the way to his house. 
The rock spoke to him and said: 

"I am the rock of destiny, and your destiny is here for you keegan"."how are you speaking, Mr. rock?" responded Keegan. "No matter, follow me now
or forever be condemned to anguish." the rock exclaimed and began quickly moving away.
