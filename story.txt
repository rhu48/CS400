There once was a boy named Keegan. He was a very friendly and nice boy. However, one day he got stuck between a rock and a hard place. 
He was trying to get home to relax after a day of struggles, but a large rock with a face blocked the way to his house. 
The rock spoke to him and said: 

"I am the rock of destiny, and your destiny is here for you keegan"."how are you speaking, Mr. rock?" responded Keegan. "No matter, follow me now
or forever be condemned to anguish." the rock exclaimed and began quickly moving away. 

Keegan was utterly perplexed, but curious enough to follow along behind the rock. Besides, he was sure that this 'Rock of Destiny' would just move back in front of his house anyways. 
After a short while the rock move forth into a cave an said, "Now, Keegan... you must pick up this rock and move it outside the cave about 3 ft to the left of the path we took to get here," the rock then settled down and did not move. 
"Wha- why do I have to do this why can't you?!" Keegan exlaimed. However, the Rock of Destiny did not respond nor did it move. Thus, Keegan rolled his eyes and moved the heavy stone returning home afterwards. 
To this day, he still wonders how exactly moving a mere rock was his destiny, but he decided not to question destiny itself in the end.
